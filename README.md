I have created a UFO Sightings Tracker JavaFX application which displays graphical representations of worldwide UFO sightings.

The main application uses a local database.  Running "CSVtoSQLConversionUtility" creates the "Create_UFO_Database.sql" file containing SQL statements
which can be used to create your own local version of the database required for the main application to function fully.
